## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

1. [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0): You'll need the .NET SDK to build and run .NET applications. Download and install the appropriate version for your operating system from the official website. (Usually it's [Windows x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-7.0.401-windows-x64-installer))


2. [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/): VSCode is a lightweight, open-source code editor that works well with .NET development. You can download it for free from the official website.

After installing, execute following command on a terminal to see if .NET was installed correctly.

```bash
dotnet --list-sdks
```

This should provide an output like: `7.0.401 [C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk]`
## Clone the Repository

To get started, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishanc/DesignPatternsDemo.git
```

Or download this repository as a `zip` file.

## Open the Project in VSCode

1. Launch Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

2. Click on the "File" menu and select "Open Folder..."

3. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository, select the folder, and click the "Open" button.

## Open the Integrated Terminal

To open the integrated terminal in VSCode, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Terminal" menu in VSCode.

2. Select "New Terminal" from the dropdown menu.

3. A terminal panel should appear at the bottom of the VSCode window.

## Build and Run the Application

Now that you have the project open in VSCode and the integrated terminal is ready, you can build and run the .NET Console Application. 

In the integrated terminal, execute the following command to build and run the application:

```bash
dotnet watch run
```

This command will compile and execute your .NET Console Application. You should see the output in the terminal.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the development environment, cloned the project, opened it in VSCode, and executed the application. You can now start modifying the code.
